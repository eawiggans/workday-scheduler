# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This project creates a schedule for the current date and time, where the user can input hourly tasks and obligations to keep track of their time during the work day. Time management is very important, and tools to manage it contribute to success in achieving goals and being productive. Past, present, and future are indicated in the time blocks to keep track of the day as it progresses.

## Usage

Users will see the current date and time at the top of the page. They can input events by entering tasks into the hourly slots and clicking the corresponding "Save" button to save their notes to the page. They will know where in the day they stand based on color-coding of the time blocks.

The app looks like this:

and can be found live on the web here:   ```
